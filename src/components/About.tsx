            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
            I’m a Computer Science student at the University of Waterloo with a deep passion for machine learning and artificial intelligence. I thrive at the intersection of AI, software engineering, and data science, constantly exploring innovative ways to apply AI to real-world challenges. Beyond AI, I enjoy full-stack development, Game Development and Web Development.

            When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me snowboarding, reading science fiction, or climbing. I’m always open to new challenges, collaborations, and learning opportunities—let’s build something amazing! Shoot me an email if you want to work on a project together!
